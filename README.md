Hypixel Skyblock Remake in Python. A command-line-based RPG game.
(only support Ironman mode for now)

Requires Skyblock-Data repo, [Skyblock Data](https://github.com/peter-hunt/skyblock-data), which will install automatically.

The data required will be auto-cached, and it will auto-update every 12 hours.

The project is in Beta cause there is no Alpha!

# Credit
Quotes from Simon are shown on [BlueCommander](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz7Lqnbo-QA-kyE34S5PTnQ)'s [Hypixel Skyblock Recreate release video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvsjASwuZv4).

His quotes contain rules about remaking Hypixel Skyblock, including not charging clones for money, not for monetization uses, not confusing other players thinking that this is the real Hypixel Skyblock. This project is along all of the rules above, which could make this project valid, but I haven't contracted with Hypixel staff for official permission yet, which I'll do later.

# Warning!
This project is still in heavy development, so the data structures used for caching and saving data will change. If you'd like to play this game in Beta, and your saved files get out of data or just from strange bugs, your files will corrupt.

If your data folder corrupts, delete the whole `~/skyblock/data` folder to let the program fix it.
If your saved files go corrupt, then it's probably not going to be resolved. Maybe I'll implement better usage, but the profile isn't like going to work again.
